;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines the types of the various messages that can be sent by Isabelle.
;; We must define them in a separate file (and not in the file we want to use).

;;; Code:

(require 'lsp-mode)

	       (:constructor lsp-isar-ov-create)
	       ;; :named is not really useful in our case
